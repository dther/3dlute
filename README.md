# 3D Lute Project

An attempt at making a cheap and accessible student lute that can be printed on a standard FDM 3D printer,
and be similar enough in tone and playing style to be useful for learning the fundamentals.

Various instruments of the Renaissance-Baroque lute family will hopefully become available.
Currently, only one instrument is being worked on.

## Current Instruments

 - Lutekulele *WIP* - A lute-shaped ukelele, strung in doubled courses and tuned g-c-e-a,
   with the G course in octaves and all others in unison.
   Primarily a proof-of-concept that this project is at all possible.
   Could charitably be called a "mandore" or "mandolino", and restrung to have a more historical
   tuning of g-f-g-f or g-c-g-c.

## Planned instruments

 - Medieval Lute - An early medieval lute, 4 strings in double courses.
 - 6c Tenor Renaissance Lute - The goal of this project.
 - 12c Baroque Lute - Hopefully. I doubt this kind of thing is possible.
